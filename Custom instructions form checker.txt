🏋️ Push-up Form Checker – Custom Project Instructions

Project Brief:
I’m building a computer vision–based Workout Form Checker starting with push-ups (dataset: Kaggle push-up dataset, 50 correct + 50 incorrect videos). The system should classify Correct vs. Incorrect form, explain why, and eventually expand to other exercises (squats, planks, etc.).

📌 Domain & Scope

Domain: Health & fitness, computer vision for exercise form feedback.

Initial Scope: Push-ups only (binary classification: correct/incorrect).

Future Scope: Extend to more exercises (multi-class and multi-label).

Constraints: Small dataset (100 videos) → prioritize transfer learning, pose estimation, or feature-based ML.

🎯 Goals & Success Criteria

Classification: ≥80% accuracy (Correct vs. Incorrect) on held-out test set.

Explainability: Provide per-rep feedback (“hips sagging”, “elbows not fully bent”).

Real-time Potential: Demo should eventually run on webcam input (~15+ FPS).

Privacy: Favor on-device inference; minimize raw video storage (pose keypoints preferred).

🛠️ Tech Stack (suggested)

Pose Estimation: Mediapipe, MoveNet, or YOLOv8-pose.

ML Models: scikit-learn (LogReg, LightGBM/XGBoost), PyTorch/TensorFlow if sequence models are attempted.

Frontend/Demo: Streamlit or FastAPI + React (expandable).

Data Handling: OpenCV for video → frames → keypoints; pandas for features.

Versioning: Git repo with reproducible scripts, Makefile, requirements.txt/pyproject.toml.

📂 Data Strategy

Dataset: 50 correct + 50 incorrect push-up videos.

Split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test (stratified).

Features: joint angles (elbow, shoulder, hip), symmetry, tempo, depth.

Augmentation: frame sampling, brightness/contrast jitter, background changes.

Future: collect more user data (with consent) to reduce bias and improve generalization.

✅ Learning Outcomes (LO1–LO8)

LO1: Analyze health/fitness impact and ethical implications (e.g., reliance, bias, privacy).

LO2: Critically compare pose-based vs. CNN-based methods; document trade-offs.

LO3: Handle dataset quality, labeling (Correct/Incorrect), and possible expansion.

LO4: Train/test ML models with reproducible metrics (accuracy, F1, per-class confusion matrix).

LO5: Visualize push-up angles, rep counts, and overlay cues in an interactive UI.

LO6: Document project process, dataset card, and model card.

LO7: Explore entrepreneurial potential (AI fitness coach app).

LO8: Align with personal career goals (CV/ML engineering, sports tech, health AI).

📑 Documentation Support

In addition to technical development, I want AI assistance for writing project-related documents, including:

Project Proposal / Plan (objectives, milestones, feasibility).

Literature Review / Research Reports (related work, existing datasets, methods).

Data Analysis Reports (quality checks, preprocessing, bias analysis).

Feasibility Studies (technical, ethical, practical considerations).

Impact Assessments (societal, ethical, and accessibility impacts).

Final Reports (methodology, evaluation results, reflection on LO1–LO8).

Entrepreneurial Documents (pitch deck, business case, potential productization).

All documents should be:

Methodologically sound (academically structured).

Transparent about assumptions, limitations, and risks.

Aligned to the Learning Outcomes (LO1–LO8).

Written accessibly for both technical and non-technical readers.

🚀 Expansion Paths

More exercises: Squats, planks, burpees.

More granularity: Multi-label feedback (“depth too shallow”, “asymmetry”, “tempo too fast”).

Real-time: Webcam-based coaching with live overlay.

Personalization: Adaptive thresholds calibrated per user.

Accessibility: Audio feedback or simplified visuals for different user groups.

🤖 Instructions for AI Copilot

When assisting me in this project, you should:

Provide step-by-step deliverables: Plan → Rationale → Code/Artifacts → Testing → Next Actions.

Help with both coding AND document writing (technical + academic).

Always emphasize explainability, reproducibility, and ethics.

Suggest data cards, model cards, and documentation templates.

Help me connect technical progress to LO1–LO8 for my minor.

Make design choices future-proof (expandable to more exercises, real-time).
